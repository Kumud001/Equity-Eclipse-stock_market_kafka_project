# Stock Market Real-Time Data Engineering Project

## Introduction

This project aims to provide an end-to-end data engineering solution for processing real-time stock market data. Leveraging a range of technologies including Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming, Python for programming, and various AWS services for data storage, processing, and querying, this solution offers a scalable and efficient approach to handling stock market data. 

## Architecture Overview

The project architecture integrates several key components to facilitate the collection, processing, and analysis of real-time stock market data:

- **Apache Kafka**: Serves as the central data streaming platform, ingesting real-time stock market data.
- **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Acts as the primary data storage solution, where raw and processed data are stored.
- **AWS Glue Crawler and Catalog**: Automate the cataloging of data stored in S3, making it searchable and queryable.
- **AWS Athena**: Provides a serverless interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.
- **AWS EC2**: Hosts the Kafka brokers and other processing services as needed.
- **Python**: Used for scripting and automation of data processing tasks.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.12
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**:
  - S3 (Simple Storage Service)
  - Athena
  - Glue Crawler
  - Glue Catalog
  - EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- **Apache Kafka**: Version 3.7.0

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and manage S3 buckets, Athena queries, Glue Crawlers, EC2 instances, and any other required resources.
- Apache Kafka setup (either locally for development or using managed services).
- Python installed on your local machine or development environment.

### Configuration

1. **AWS Configuration**:
   - Set up an S3 bucket for storing raw and processed data.
   - Configure AWS Glue Crawler and Catalog to organize your data schema.
   - Set up Athena for SQL-based data analysis.

2. **Apache Kafka Setup**:
   - Install and configure Apache Kafka.
   - Create the necessary topics for stock market data ingestion.

3. **Python Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
   - Install required Python libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (You should create this file based on your project's dependencies).

### Running the Project

1. **Start Apache Kafka**:
   - Ensure that your Kafka brokers are running and that the topics for stock market data are correctly configured.

2. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Run the Python scripts designed to ingest real-time stock market data into Kafka.

3. **Data Processing and Storage**:
   - Utilize AWS Glue and S3 to process and store the data accordingly.

4. **Analysis**:
   - Perform data analysis using AWS Athena with the provided SQL queries to gain insights into the stock market data.
